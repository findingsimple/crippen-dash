Broad/global changes listed here. Otherwise see the github repo for exact line edits.

Questions
- Will the membership cards page/template have breadcrumbs like the other accounts page? Template provided doesn't appear to have them. If so - they can setup the same as the others.
- I'm not sure the seat selection templates will be used - so I've left for the time being
